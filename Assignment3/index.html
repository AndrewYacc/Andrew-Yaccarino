        <h1 class="title"> Hagibis External Headphone-Microphone Adapter </h1>
        <p>I got a new computer that came with a 3.5mm headphone jack, but did not support a microphone.</p>
        <p>I found a listing on amazon for a 3.5mm to USB adapter for a resonable price.</p>
        <p>The device is easy to fit into a carrying case for a laptop due to it's small size.</p>

        <p>The product works flawlessly and I continue to use it to this day.</p>
