            <h1>My Favorate Trails</h1>
			<p>Biking has always been a favorite activity of mine since I was quite young. My family and I bicycled often, both locally and within a day's drive of our Milwaukee home. Riding on off-road trails provided safety for the youngest member of the family while the State's Rails-to-Trails promised an easy ride. As I have gotten older, I enjoy cycling as a form of excercize, recreation, and socialization. The following trails and links to their websites are some of my favorites. Each link will provide information and history about the trail. Please not the weather alerts for each location before starting out.</p>
